Using plain HTML, CSS 3 and minimal JavaScript, implement a Tree View based on the above data structure. Specifications:
- Each tree node has an "expander" symbol.
- In collapsed state the expander is a "right angle" symbol.
- in expanded state the same symbol is rotated 90 degrees to the right (a.k.a: downwards)
- The switch between the expanded/collapsed state should me animated (0.6 seconds)
- When a node is expanded/collapsed the transition should me animated in the same timeframe (0.6 seconds)
