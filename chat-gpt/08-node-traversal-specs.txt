Can you write a Typescript function traversing each node of the above tree model, having the following signature:
function traverse(treeModel, specialNodeIds: number[], specialNodeProcessor: Function, otherNodeProcessor: Function):void;
- The above function should visit each node in the tree.
- If the visited node's id is among the  specialNodeIds ==> the specialNodeProcessor function should be called on the current node.
- If the visited node's id is not found among the  specialNodeIds (a.k.a is any other node)==> the otherNodeProcessor function should be called on the current (non-special) node.
